# nixos-config

This repository contains the Nix / NixOS configuration for all of my systems. See [nixos-unified](https://nixos-unified.org)—specifically [nixos-unified-template](https://github.com/juspay/nixos-unified-template)—if you wish to create your own configuration from scratch.

## Getting started

### Deploying

Update the configuration of the system by running below command from the `devShell`

```sh
just deploy zion
```
